Question- What is string in js?
Answer- A JavaScript string stores a series of characters like "John Doe". A string can be any text inside double
or single quotes.




Question- What is array in js?
Answer- An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value may be of different datatype.




Question- What is object in js?
Answer- An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and 
a value.




Question- What are classes and objects in js?
Answer- Class is a blueprint that defines some properties and behaviors. An object is an instance of a class 
that has those properties and behaviours attached. A class is not allocated memory when it is defined. An object 
is allocated memory when it is created.




Question- What is this keyword?
Answer- “This” keyword refers to an object that is executing the current piece of code. It references the object 
that is executing the current function.




Question- What is static function?
Answer- Static class methods are defined on the class itself. You cannot call a static method on an object, only 
on an class.




Question- What is JSON?
Answer- JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. JSON is a text format for storing and transporting data.
It is basically used to convert objects to strings or strings to objects.




Question- Why JSON does not support functions?
Answer- JSON doesn't support functions because functions are executable code, and JSON's purpose is to describe 
data, not behavior. Functions are a part of the logic or behavior of a program and are not inherently representable
in a data-interchange format like JSON.




Question- What is shallow copy and deep copy?
Answer- Shallow Copy stores the references of objects to the original memory address. Deep copy stores copies of 
the object's value. Shallow Copy reflects changes made to the new/copied object in the original object. Deep copy 
doesn't reflect changes made to the new/copied object in the original object.







Here’s the explanation in Hinglish (a mix of Hindi and English):

**Question- What is string in JS?**  
**Answer**- JavaScript mein string ek aisi data type hoti hai jo characters ki series ko store karti hai, jaise "John Doe". String koi bhi text ho sakti hai jo double ya single quotes ke andar likha ho.

---

**Question- What is array in JS?**  
**Answer**- Array ek special variable hai jo ek se zyada values ko store kar sakta hai. Yeh values alag-alag data types ki bhi ho sakti hain.

---

**Question- What is object in JS?**  
**Answer**- Object ek collection hota hai properties ka, aur har property ka ek name (ya key) aur value hoti hai. Matlab, object kisi cheez ke attributes ko define karta hai.

---

**Question- What are classes and objects in JS?**  
**Answer**- Class ek blueprint hoti hai jo kuch properties aur behaviors ko define karti hai. Object ek instance hota hai class ka, jisme woh properties aur behaviors hote hain jo class ne define kiye hain. Jab class define hoti hai, tab usse memory allocate nahi hoti, lekin jab object create hota hai, tab usko memory allocate hoti hai.

**Question- What is `this` keyword?**  
**Answer**- `This` keyword us object ko refer karta hai jo current code ko execute kar raha hai. Matlab, jab aap kisi function ke andar `this` use karte ho, toh woh us object ko point karta hai jo function ko call kar raha hai.

---

**Question- What is static function?**  
**Answer**- Static class methods wo methods hote hain jo class pe directly define hote hain. Aap static method ko object pe call nahi kar sakte, bas class pe hi call kar sakte hain.

---

**Question- What is JSON?**  
**Answer**- JSON ka full form hai JavaScript Object Notation. JSON ek text format hota hai jo data ko store aur transport karne ke liye use hota hai. Yeh basically objects ko strings mein convert karta hai ya strings ko objects mein convert karta hai.

---

**Question- Why JSON does not support functions?**  
**Answer**- JSON functions ko support nahi karta kyunki functions executable code hote hain, aur JSON ka purpose sirf data ko describe karna hai, na ki program ka behavior. Functions program ke logic ka part hote hain, jo data-interchange format mein represent nahi kiye ja sakte.

---

**Question- What is shallow copy and deep copy?**  
**Answer**-  
- **Shallow Copy**: Shallow copy mein objects ke references ko original memory address tak store kiya jata hai. Matlab, agar aap copied object mein koi changes karte hain, toh woh changes original object mein bhi reflect hote hain.
- **Deep Copy**: Deep copy mein object ke values ko copy kiya jata hai, na ki references ko. Matlab, agar aap copied object mein changes karte ho, toh woh changes original object mein reflect nahi hote.
