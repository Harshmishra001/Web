Question- What is JavaScript?
Answer- JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted programming 
language. It is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of 
web pages, and many non-browser environments also use it.




Question- Why languages?
Answer- Programming languages are used in web development because they enable humans to communicate 
instructions to computers in a readable format.




Question- Why javascript is better than other language?
Answer- It is cross-platform compatible and is supported by all major web browsers. Both the front-end and 
the back-end of websites may be developed using JavaScript, which, when done right, captures seamless 
communication between the client and the server.




Question- Why javascript is a dynamic language?
Answer- Javascript is a dynamic typing language. When you declare a variable, you do not need to specify 
what type this variable is. 




Question- Explain single threaded nature of javascript?
Answer- Javascript is a single threaded language. This means it has one call stack and one memory heap. 
As expected, it executes code in order and must finish executing a piece code before moving onto the next.




Question- What is compile-time and run-time?
Answer- Compile-time refers to the phase during which a program is translated from the source code into 
machine code or an intermediate code by a compiler. Whereas run-time, or execution time, is the period when 
a program is actually running and performing its tasks on a computer.




Question- What is difference between interpreted languages and compiled languages?
Answer- Compiled languages-
1. First need to compile, then need to run.
2. Usually don't compile, if there is an error in the code.
3. Eg- C, C++, Java etc.

Interpreted languages-
1. Usually go line by line.
2. Can run partially if error comes later.
3. Eg- Javascript, Python etc.




Question- What is the difference between interpreter and compiler?
Answer- A compiler translates code from a high-level programming language into machine code before the program runs. 
An interpreter translates code written in a high-level programming language into machine code line-by-line as the 
code runs.




Question- What are variables in javascript?
Answer- A JavaScript variable is simply a name of storage location. Three ways to create variables- let, var 
and const.




Question- What are datatypes in javascript?
Answer- Datatypes describe the type of data that variables can store. Datatypes in javascript are integer, string,
big int, boolean, null, undefined, object and symbol.

**Question- What is compile-time and run-time?**  
**Answer**- Compile-time wo phase hota hai jab program ko source code se machine code ya intermediate code mein convert kiya jaata hai compiler ke through. Run-time, ya execution time, wo time hota hai jab program actual mein run ho raha hota hai aur apne tasks ko computer par perform kar raha hota hai.

**Question- What is the difference between interpreted languages and compiled languages?**  
**Answer**  
**Compiled languages:**
1. Sabse pehle compile karna padta hai, fir run karte hain.  
2. Agar code mein koi error hota hai, toh usually woh compile nahi hota.  
3. Example: C, C++, Java etc.

**Interpreted languages:**
1. Line by line execute hoti hain.  
2. Agar error aata hai toh code partially bhi run ho sakta hai.  
3. Example: JavaScript, Python etc.

**Question- What is the difference between interpreter and compiler?**  
**Answer**- Compiler code ko high-level programming language se machine code mein convert karta hai, lekin program run hone se pehle. Interpreter code ko high-level programming language se machine code mein line-by-line convert karta hai jab program run ho raha hota hai.
